INPUT:
cash
nkg_onions
onion_price
nkg_grapes
grape_price
nkg_apricots

PROCEESS:
1. bill = (nkg_onions * onion_price) + (nkg_grapes * grape_price) + (nkg_apricots * apricots_price) + (nkg_tomatoes * tomatoes_price)
2. diff = cash - bill
3. IF diff >= 0 THEN
4. IF diff == 0 THEN
5. PRINT "No change left. Thank you for shopping!"
6. ELSE PRINT "Here's your change:" diff "Thank you for shopping!"
7. ELSE IF diff < 0 THEN 
8. PRINT "Pay full amount! Remaining amount to pay:" diff
9. END

OUTPUT:
Keeping in mind the cash the user carriers, how much would he need to pay if on a particular day he buys items making sure 
that the prices for the items the user bought are taken as input. We also checked that according to the cash the user has,
if he would need to pay more or if we will get the change back or if he has the exact amount as the bill.  

Basically a gorcery calculator telling if the items he bought require more money than he already has, less money than he already has
or cost the exact same as the cash he has.
